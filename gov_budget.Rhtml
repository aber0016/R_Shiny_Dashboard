<p style="color:navy;"><b> Government Budgets</b></p> 

In order to assess the question of how governments adjusted their fiscal policy to address the crisis we assess buget data. The data sets used seek to assess changes in fiscal policy as a response to the financial crisis. This is achieved through looking at the total budget expenditures on 'agriculture', 'defense', 'education', 'health', 'mining', 'social protection','transport and communication', and 'others' over time for each of the four countries. To make the data comaprable over time and across countries it is measured per capita expenditure in purchasing power adjusted 2005 USD.

<br>

<br> More specifically we will focus on analysing two key budget expenditures which are ‘per capita transport and communication expenditure in 2005 $ppp’, and ‘per capita social protection expenditure in 2005 $ppp’ for all four countries.These specific statistics on public expenditure were chosen since social protection, as well as infrastructure expenditure, is considered to be one of the most important pillars in Keynesian economic theory when substituting private with public demand.3 To showcase how expenditure changed over time we use a radar plot which can display the budget distribution for each country for each year using a drop down menu as well as a year slider.

<p style="color:navy;"><b>Transport & Communication Expenditure</b></p> 

The sectors of transportation and communication commonly experience cyclical trends. In times of crisis, governments seek to create jobs and substitute lingering private demand through public expenditure in capital intensive industries such as transportation and communication.It can be seen that public expenditure in transportation & communication sharply increased from 2007 until 2011 in Germany and South Africa. The United States on the other hand only saw a modest increase in expenditure. This difference could be explained through the US’ stronger focus on unconventional monetary policy steps such as ‘quantitative easing’. Similarly, India saw little to no increase in transportation & communication expenditure.

<p style="color:navy;"><b>Social Protection Expenditure</b></p> 

Social protection expenditure experiences similar cyclical trends. This is due to the fact that governments deploying Keynesian/demand-side economic policies seek to stimulate economic growth through raising aggregate demand.6 One simple and direct mechanism of achieving that is by directly providing the most vulnerable households in society with cash since they have one of the greatest propensities to consume.7 Moreover, this is an effective method to protect such households from significant hardship. It can be observed in both the United States as well as Germany social protection expenditure increased from 2007 onwards. However, in the United States, that increase was significantly larger than in Germany. This could be since Germany by default has a very elaborate social safety net and spends a lot on social protection measures, whereas in the United States per capita expenditure is significantly lower on a baseline. Thus, during times of crisis, the US would have to increase spending significantly to foster demand and avert hardship for the more vulnerable parts of society. South Africa and India appear to be spending an almost low identical amount per capita on social protection. In both countries expenditure only increased from 2010 onwards by a marginal amount. This could be explained through the fact that both are middle-income countries, which commonly have a fewer funds available per capita to spend on social protection.
