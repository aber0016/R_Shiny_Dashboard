# R_Shiny_Dashboard

This project is an interactive R Shiny visualisation which seek to answer two main research questions – the socio-economic impact of the Great Financial Crisis and the fiscal policies adopted. 

The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008 was one of the worst financial crises on record, wiping out a decade worth of economic progress in many countries and plunging millions of people around the world into poverty.1 To develop a more nuanced understanding of the crisis dynamic’s, this visualisation project seeks to investigate the socio-economic effects and fiscal policy responses of the GFC through a data- driven approach. More specifically, the project aims to analyse and visualize socio-economic indicators and government budgets of the United States, Germany, India, and South Africa over the years of 2000 to 2015. The four countries were chosen to compare differences between high- and middle-income countries regarding the effects and response to the crisis. The two main research questions we will seek to answer are:

1. “What were the socio-economic effects of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 in the United States, Germany, India, and South Africa?”
2. “How did the governments of these states adjust their fiscal policy to address the crisis and how did such policy reforms affect socio-economic welfare?”
